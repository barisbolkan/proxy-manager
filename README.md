# ProxyManager
ProxyManager is a visual studio extension that enables to add or configure service references very easily. The big adventage of this extension is it can only create contracts or contracts and implementation. By generating only contracts you can easily seperate the implementation and the contracts in different assemblies. So in this particular reason it is real helpfull for dependency frameworks.
